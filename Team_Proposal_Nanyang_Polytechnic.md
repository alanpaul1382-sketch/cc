|-----------|-------------------|
| Certificate fraud and forgery | Tamper-proof digital credentials on blockchain |
| Slow manual verification process | Instant online verification by employers |
| Limited portability of credentials | Globally accessible digital certificates |
| High administrative cost of verification | Automated, self-service verification |
| Lack of micro-credential tracking | Granular recording of skills and achievements |

### 8.3 How Blockchain Improves NYP's Business Processes

**Secure Digital Certificate Issuance:**
Using blockchain technology, NYP can issue tamper-proof digital certificates for:
- **Graduation diplomas** that employers can verify instantly online
- **Competition awards** (e.g., hackathon winners, project showcase prizes) recorded permanently on the blockchain
- **CET and short course certificates** that support lifelong learning records
- **Micro-credentials and digital badges** for specific skills acquired during coursework

**Streamlined Verification Process:**
Currently, employers and overseas institutions must contact NYP's administrative office to verify a graduate's credentials, which can take days or weeks. With blockchain verification, this process is reduced to seconds — the verifier simply scans a QR code or enters a certificate ID to confirm its authenticity.

**Comprehensive Student Portfolio:**
Blockchain enables the creation of a comprehensive, verifiable student portfolio that includes not just academic qualifications but also:
- Co-curricular achievements
- Industry certifications (e.g., Microsoft, AWS, Cisco)
- Internship completion records
- Competition results and awards
