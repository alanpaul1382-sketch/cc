### 7.7 Key Challenges for Adoption

1. **Data Privacy and Ethics:** AI systems process sensitive student data. NYP must ensure compliance with Singapore's PDPA and establish clear ethical guidelines for AI use, including transparency about how student data is collected, used, and stored.

2. **Algorithmic Bias:** AI models trained on historical data may perpetuate existing biases (e.g., gender or racial biases in student performance predictions). Regular auditing and bias mitigation strategies are essential.

3. **Faculty Resistance and Training:** Some lecturers may resist AI adoption due to concerns about job displacement or unfamiliarity with the technology. Comprehensive training and clear communication about AI as a complementary tool (not a replacement) are critical.

4. **Integration Complexity:** Integrating AI systems with NYP's existing Learning Management System (LMS), Student Management System, and other IT infrastructure requires careful planning and potentially significant middleware development.

5. **Over-Reliance on AI:** There is a risk that students and staff may become overly dependent on AI tools, potentially impacting critical thinking skills and human judgment. Clear guidelines on appropriate AI use must be established.

6. **Cost Justification:** The initial investment for comprehensive AI adoption is significant. NYP must build a strong business case demonstrating tangible ROI to secure budget approval from MOE and institutional leadership.
