## Part A – Questions the Interviewer May Ask (with Suggested Answers)

---

### A1. Personal / "Tell Me About Yourself" Questions

**Q1: Tell me about yourself.**

> **A:** Good morning. My name is _____, and I am currently a Year ___ student at Nanyang Polytechnic, pursuing a diploma in _____. I have a strong foundation in data analytics, including proficiency in SQL, Python, and Excel, which I developed through coursework and self-initiated projects. For instance, I recently worked on a team project where we analyzed how emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain could benefit an educational institution, which sharpened my ability to conduct market research, interpret data, and present insights clearly. I am passionate about e-commerce and excited about the opportunity to apply my analytical skills at Lazada, a company at the forefront of Southeast Asia's digital economy.

**Q2: Why are you interested in this Data Analyst internship at Lazada?**

> **A:** Lazada is Southeast Asia's leading e-commerce platform, operating across six countries and serving hundreds of millions of consumers. What excites me most is how Lazada leverages data and AI to drive business decisions — from personalised product recommendations to campaign optimisation and fraud detection. I want to be part of a data-driven company where I can contribute meaningful analysis while learning from experienced professionals. The scale and diversity of Lazada's operations means I would be exposed to large, complex datasets, which is exactly the environment in which I want to grow as a data analyst.

**Q3: What do you know about Lazada?**

> **A:** Lazada was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in Singapore. It operates in six Southeast Asian countries — Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. It was acquired by Alibaba Group in 2016, which gave it access to Alibaba's world-class technology infrastructure in logistics, cloud computing, and big data. Lazada's mission is to accelerate progress in Southeast Asia through commerce and technology, and it aims to serve 300 million customers by 2030. Key offerings include the Lazada marketplace, LazMall (its branded virtual mall guaranteeing product authenticity), Lazada Logistics, and integrated digital payment solutions. Recently, Lazada has invested heavily in AI-driven personalisation, the LazzieChat AI assistant for shoppers, and AI-powered seller tools like the Lazzie Seller assistant, which help merchants create better listings and manage operations. The company has also achieved positive EBITDA, demonstrating that its technology investments are translating into profitability.

**Q4: Why did you choose data analytics as a career path?**

> **A:** I have always been fascinated by how patterns hidden in data can reveal actionable insights. During my studies, I discovered that I enjoy the problem-solving process of cleaning, analysing, and visualising data to tell a story. What motivates me is the practical impact — data analytics directly influences real business decisions, whether it's improving customer experience, optimising marketing campaigns, or detecting fraud. The e-commerce industry, in particular, generates vast amounts of data, making it an ideal field for a data analyst to make a tangible difference.

### A2. Skills and Technical Questions

**Q5: What technical skills do you have that are relevant to a Data Analyst role?**

> **A:** I am proficient in SQL for querying and manipulating relational databases, which I understand is a core skill for data work at Lazada. I also have experience with Python, particularly the pandas and matplotlib libraries, for data cleaning, transformation, and visualisation. I am comfortable using Microsoft Excel for quick analyses and pivot tables. Additionally, I have exposure to data visualisation tools such as Tableau and Power BI for creating dashboards and communicating findings to stakeholders. I am also familiar with basic statistical concepts such as hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression, which are important for deriving reliable insights.

**Q6: Can you walk me through how you would approach analysing a drop in sales on the Lazada platform?**

> **A:** First, I would clarify the scope — is the sales drop across all categories, specific products, or certain regions? Next, I would pull the relevant data using SQL and segment it by time period, product category, geography, and customer demographics. I would check for external factors such as seasonality, competitor promotions, or public holidays. Then I would look at internal metrics: changes in website traffic, conversion rates, average order value, cart abandonment rates, and any recent changes to the app or pricing. I would use data visualisation to identify patterns and anomalies. Finally, I would summarise my findings, propose hypotheses ranked by likelihood, and recommend next steps, such as A/B testing a new promotion or investigating a technical issue, presenting these to the team in a clear, concise report.

**Q7: How would you handle a messy or incomplete dataset?**

> **A:** Data cleaning is a critical first step. I would start by understanding the data dictionary and the expected schema. Then I would check for missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and outliers. For missing values, I would evaluate whether to impute them (using mean, median, or mode), drop the rows, or flag them depending on the proportion of missing data and its impact on analysis. I would document all cleaning steps so the process is reproducible and transparent. In a professional context like Lazada, I would also consult with the data engineering team to understand why the data is incomplete, as it might indicate an upstream pipeline issue that needs fixing.

**Q8: What is a p-value and when would you use it?**

> **A:** A p-value measures the probability of observing results at least as extreme as the ones obtained, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In practical terms, if I were testing whether a new promotional campaign at Lazada led to a statistically significant increase in conversions, I would set up a hypothesis test. A p-value below the significance level (commonly 0.05) would indicate that the observed improvement is unlikely to be due to random chance, giving us confidence to recommend scaling the campaign.

**Q9: What data visualisation tools have you used, and how do you decide which chart type to use?**

> **A:** I have used Tableau, Power BI, and Python's matplotlib and seaborn libraries. The choice of chart depends on the story I want to tell: I use line charts for trends over time (e.g., daily sales), bar charts for category comparisons (e.g., sales by product category), pie charts sparingly for proportional breakdowns, scatter plots for exploring relationships between two variables, and heatmaps for correlation matrices. At Lazada, I imagine dashboards would be critical for monitoring KPIs like conversion rates, GMV, and customer retention in real time, and I would tailor visualisations to the audience — more detail for analysts, cleaner summaries for business stakeholders.

**Q10: Describe a project where you used data to make a recommendation.**

> **A:** In a recent school project, our team analysed how emerging technologies could benefit Nanyang Polytechnic. I was responsible for researching AI-driven solutions. I gathered data on student retention rates, administrative costs, and EdTech market trends. Using this data, I built a cost-benefit analysis showing that deploying an AI chatbot could reduce administrative workload by up to SGD 2–4 million per year while improving student retention by 10–15%. I presented these findings with charts and a five-year ROI projection, which the team used to support our overall recommendation. This experience taught me how to translate raw data into business-relevant insights.

### A3. Behavioural and Situational Questions

**Q11: Tell me about a time you worked effectively in a team.**

> **A:** During our Emerging Technologies team project, I collaborated with three other members, each covering a different technology. As the team worked on a tight deadline, I took the initiative to set up a shared document tracker and scheduled weekly check-ins to ensure alignment. When one team member was struggling to find data for their section, I helped them identify relevant sources and cross-checked their figures. This collaborative approach helped us deliver a cohesive 20-page proposal on time. I learned that proactive communication and mutual support are key to team success.

**Q12: How do you handle tight deadlines and multiple tasks?**

> **A:** I prioritise tasks based on urgency and impact. I use a simple task list or project management tool to track what needs to be done and by when. For example, during exam season, I had overlapping assignments and exam preparation. I broke each task into smaller milestones, estimated the time needed, and created a daily schedule. I also communicate with team members or supervisors early if I foresee any challenges. I believe this approach would serve me well at Lazada, where business-critical analyses often need to be delivered on tight timelines, especially during major sale events like 6.6 or 9.9 campaigns.

**Q13: Describe a time you had to explain something technical to a non-technical person.**

> **A:** In our project presentation, I had to explain how an AI-based adaptive learning system works to an audience that included non-technical classmates. Instead of diving into algorithms, I used an analogy: I compared the AI to a personal tutor who observes how a student learns, identifies their weak spots, and adjusts the lesson plan accordingly. I supported this with a simple flowchart visual rather than a technical diagram. The feedback was positive — my audience understood the concept clearly. I believe this skill is crucial at Lazada, where data analysts frequently present findings to marketing, operations, and leadership teams.

**Q14: How do you deal with criticism or feedback on your work?**

> **A:** I view feedback as an opportunity to improve. For example, during a school project, my tutor pointed out that my cost-benefit analysis lacked sufficient justification for some assumptions. Rather than taking it personally, I went back, researched industry benchmarks, and revised my figures with proper citations. The final version was much stronger. In a professional environment like Lazada, I would actively seek feedback from senior analysts and stakeholders to ensure my analyses are accurate, relevant, and aligned with business objectives.

**Q15: What is your greatest strength?**

> **A:** My greatest strength is my analytical curiosity. I don't just look at what the data says — I dig deeper to understand why. When I see a trend or anomaly, I investigate the underlying factors and consider multiple hypotheses before drawing conclusions. This thoroughness has helped me produce more insightful analyses in my school projects, and I believe it would add value at Lazada, where understanding the "why" behind customer behaviour and sales patterns can directly impact business strategy.

**Q16: What is your greatest weakness?**

> **A:** I sometimes spend too much time perfecting the details of my analysis before sharing it. I have learned that in a fast-paced environment, delivering an 80% complete analysis on time is often more valuable than a perfect analysis delivered late. I have been practising setting time limits for each stage of my work and sharing drafts early for feedback. I believe this is especially important at Lazada, where timely insights during a live campaign can have an immediate business impact.

### A4. Company Culture and Fit Questions

**Q17: How do you think you would fit into Lazada's culture?**

> **A:** Lazada's culture emphasises innovation, customer-centricity, and data-driven decision-making, all of which resonate with me. I thrive in environments where I can use data to solve real problems and see the impact of my work. Lazada's focus on empowering both consumers and sellers aligns with my interest in using analytics for meaningful outcomes. Additionally, I am adaptable and enjoy learning new tools and methods, which I think is essential in a fast-moving tech and e-commerce company like Lazada.

**Q18: Where do you see yourself in three to five years?**

> **A:** In three to five years, I see myself as a skilled data analyst capable of leading end-to-end analytical projects — from defining the problem and gathering data to building models and presenting recommendations to senior leadership. I hope to deepen my expertise in e-commerce analytics and potentially grow into a data science role, where I can build predictive models and contribute to strategic decision-making. Lazada's scale and its investment in technology make it an ideal place to build that career trajectory.

**Q19: How do you stay current with developments in data analytics and technology?**

> **A:** I regularly follow industry publications and blogs such as Towards Data Science, KDnuggets, and the IMDA technology roadmap for Singapore-specific trends. I also take online courses on platforms like Coursera and Kaggle to keep my skills sharp — for example, I recently completed a course on SQL for data analysis. I participate in Kaggle competitions when I can, as they expose me to diverse datasets and analytical techniques. Staying current is important because the tools and methods in data analytics evolve rapidly, especially in a technology-forward company like Lazada.

### A5. Scenario-Based / Case Questions

**Q20: Lazada is planning a major 9.9 Mega Sale campaign. How would you use data to help the team prepare?**

> **A:** I would start by analysing historical data from previous mega sale events — looking at traffic patterns, top-selling categories, conversion rates, peak hours, and customer demographics. I would segment customers by behaviour (new vs. returning, high-value vs. casual browsers) to help the marketing team tailor promotions. I would also analyse inventory data to identify which products are likely to sell out and recommend stock-up quantities. During the event, I would monitor real-time dashboards tracking KPIs such as GMV, orders per minute, and cart abandonment rates, and flag any anomalies for immediate action. Post-campaign, I would conduct a comprehensive analysis comparing actual results against targets and provide insights for future campaigns.

**Q21: How would you measure the effectiveness of Lazada's AI-powered recommendation engine?**

> **A:** I would look at several key metrics: click-through rate (CTR) on recommended products, conversion rate from recommendation to purchase, average order value for users who engaged with recommendations versus those who did not, and customer retention rates. I would also run A/B tests comparing the AI-driven recommendations against a control group (e.g., showing trending products instead) to isolate the impact of the recommendation engine. Additionally, I would track customer satisfaction metrics and whether recommendations reduce the time to purchase, as a good recommendation engine should make shopping more efficient and enjoyable.

**Q22: A seller on Lazada reports that their product views are high but conversions are low. How would you investigate this?**

> **A:** I would approach this systematically. First, I would pull the seller's product page data: views, add-to-cart rate, and purchase rate to pinpoint where users are dropping off in the funnel. Then I would examine product-level factors — pricing compared to competitors, product images and description quality, customer reviews and ratings, and shipping fees or delivery times. I would also look at traffic source quality — are the views coming from targeted ads or generic browse traffic? Low-intent traffic could explain high views but low conversions. Finally, I would check for technical issues such as slow page load times. I would compile these findings into a report with prioritised recommendations for the seller.
