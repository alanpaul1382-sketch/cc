## Overview

According to Arkham Intelligence, Binance is the world's largest crypto entity by on-chain holdings (~$145 billion as of February 2026). Binance's wallets contain hundreds of tokens spanning multiple blockchains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and others). While most of the value is concentrated in major listed assets (BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, SOL, etc.), Binance also holds a significant number of tokens that are **not listed for trading** on the Binance exchange.

These unlisted tokens fall into two main categories:

1. **Binance Labs (YZi Labs) Portfolio Investments** — Tokens from projects Binance has invested in through its venture arm, but has not listed for spot or futures trading.
2. **Airdropped / Unsolicited Tokens** — Tokens deposited into Binance-attributed wallets without consent, often low-liquidity or promotional tokens.
