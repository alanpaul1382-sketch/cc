# Summary: 5G and Edge Computing for Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP)

This report, prepared by Member 4 (Alex) as part of a team proposal on **Emerging Technologies for Business Transformation**, examines how **5G and Edge Computing** can transform Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP), a leading polytechnic in Singapore's education sector.

## Key Challenges Addressed

NYP faces five core challenges that 5G and Edge Computing can help solve:

1. **Ageing network infrastructure** — Campus Wi-Fi struggles with growing bandwidth demands and peak-hour congestion.
2. **Limited hybrid learning capabilities** — Latency issues and inconsistent connectivity hinder blended education delivery.
3. **Rising student expectations** — Students expect immersive, technology-rich experiences (AR/VR, AI-driven learning, smart campus services).
4. **Sustainability pressures** — Singapore's Green Plan 2030 requires reduced energy consumption and carbon footprint.
5. **Competitive pressure** — Peer institutions are investing heavily in smart campus initiatives and 5G pilots.

## Technology Overview

- **5G** provides ultra-high-speed connectivity (up to 10 Gbps), ultra-low latency (1–10 ms), and massive device connectivity (up to 1 million devices per km²).
- **Edge Computing** processes data locally on-campus rather than in distant cloud data centres, reducing latency and improving reliability.
- Together, they form a high-performance digital backbone for AI analytics, IoT networks, immersive media, and real-time collaboration.

## Benefits to NYP's Value Chain

| Area | Improvements |
|------|-------------|
| **Teaching & Learning** | Real-time hybrid classrooms (4K/8K streaming), remote smart laboratories, immersive AR/VR training |
| **Campus Operations** | High-density IoT device management, smart lighting/sensors/security, reduced network downtime (30–40% fewer interruptions) |
| **Industry Engagement** | 5G testbed partnerships, applied research funding, corporate training collaborations |

## Financial Analysis

- **Year 1 investment:** S$900,000 – S$1,900,000 (5G deployment, edge servers, network security, IT integration)
- **Annual recurring costs (Year 2+):** S$170,000 – S$350,000 (maintenance, licensing, staff training)
- **Potential annual revenue:** S$1.9 – S$3.6 million from CET programmes, research partnerships, and international expansion

## Innovative Proposal: NYP 5G Innovation Sandbox

The report proposes a **5G Innovation Sandbox Zone** — a designated on-campus testbed where students and industry partners can prototype 5G-enabled applications such as autonomous robotics, smart campus optimisation, and VR-based industry training modules.

## Conclusion

5G and Edge Computing are foundational enablers that can reshape how NYP delivers education, manages its campus, and engages with industry. The technologies offer a strong return on investment and align with Singapore's Smart Nation vision and Green Plan 2030 sustainability goals. Early adoption would position NYP as a technology leader in Singapore's polytechnic landscape.
