## 3. Current Problems and Challenges

Nanyang Polytechnic, like many education institutions in Singapore, faces several key challenges:

### 3.1 Adapting to Hybrid and Digital Learning

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to online learning. While NYP adopted virtual classrooms, the experience gap between in-person and online delivery remains significant. Practical, hands-on courses (e.g., engineering, nursing, media production) are particularly difficult to replicate online.

### 3.2 Certificate Fraud and Verification Delays

Education institutions worldwide face the challenge of certificate fraud. Verifying academic credentials is a manual, time-consuming process for employers and partner institutions. NYP must ensure the integrity and portability of its qualifications.

### 3.3 Personalized Learning at Scale

Students have varying learning speeds, styles, and strengths. The traditional one-size-fits-all approach struggles to meet individual needs, particularly in large cohort sizes. There is growing demand for adaptive, personalized learning pathways.

### 3.4 Ageing Campus Infrastructure

Managing a large physical campus with numerous laboratories, workshops, and facilities is resource-intensive. Energy consumption, space utilization, and predictive maintenance remain ongoing challenges.

### 3.5 Staying Industry-Relevant

Rapid technological change means curricula can become outdated quickly. NYP must continuously update its programmes and teaching methods to align with industry expectations and SkillsFuture priorities.

### 3.6 Environmental Sustainability

Singapore's Green Plan 2030 calls on institutions to reduce carbon emissions, optimize energy usage, and embed sustainability into operations — adding another dimension of complexity.

### 5.3 Blockchain-Based Certificate Verification — Declan

#### 5.3.1 Technology Overview

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner. In the education context, blockchain can be used to issue, store, and verify academic credentials (diplomas, certificates, competition awards) without relying on centralized intermediaries.

Key concepts:
- **Smart Contracts:** Self-executing programs on the blockchain that automate verification processes
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Unique digital identities for students and institutions
- **Verifiable Credentials:** Tamper-proof digital certificates that can be instantly verified by any party
- **NFT-based Certificates:** Non-fungible tokens representing unique achievements (graduation, competition wins)

Relevant platforms include Ethereum, Hyperledger, and purpose-built education blockchains such as Blockcerts and Open Badges.

#### 5.3.2 Current Challenges Addressed

Blockchain addresses critical challenges for NYP:

1. **Certificate Fraud:** The global rise in fake diplomas and fraudulent qualifications is a growing concern. Blockchain-based certificates are cryptographically secured and cannot be forged or tampered with.

2. **Verification Delays:** Currently, employers and partner institutions must contact NYP directly to verify qualifications — a manual process that can take days or weeks. Blockchain enables instant, self-service verification.

3. **Student Mobility:** Students transferring credits between institutions (e.g., NYP to a local university) face lengthy recognition processes. Blockchain-stored credentials streamline credit transfer and recognition.

4. **Record Keeping:** Paper-based and centralized digital records are vulnerable to loss, corruption, or system failures. Blockchain provides a permanent, distributed record.

#### 5.3.3 How Blockchain Improves the Value Chain

| Value Chain Activity | Blockchain Application | Benefit |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Assessment & Certification | Blockchain-issued diplomas and certificates | Tamper-proof, instantly verifiable credentials |

| Industry Partnerships | Verified micro-credentials for industry certifications | Trusted skills validation for employers |
| Alumni Relations | Lifelong digital credential records | Seamless re-engagement for CET courses |
| Administration | Smart contract-based award issuance (e.g., competition winners) | Automated, transparent certificate issuance |
| CET Programmes | Stackable, verifiable micro-credentials | Encourages lifelong learning and upskilling |

#### 5.3.4 Use Cases at NYP

1. **Graduation Certificates:** Upon graduation, each student receives a blockchain-based digital diploma. Employers can verify the diploma's authenticity by scanning a QR code — no need to contact NYP.

2. **Competition Awards:** When a student wins a hackathon, design competition, or academic award, an NFT-based certificate is minted on the blockchain, providing a permanent, verifiable record of achievement.

3. **CET Micro-Credentials:** Working professionals completing CET courses receive blockchain-verified micro-credentials that can be stacked towards larger qualifications.

4. **International Recognition:** Partner universities overseas can instantly verify NYP qualifications for student transfers and articulation programmes.

#### 5.3.5 Disruption to the Digital Economy

Blockchain-based credentials will disrupt the education landscape:

- **Eliminating Verification Intermediaries:** Traditional verification services (e.g., WES, ICAS) may be disintermediated as institutions issue directly verifiable credentials.
- **Student-Owned Data:** Learners gain ownership and control over their academic records, aligned with self-sovereign identity principles.
- **Global Credential Portability:** A universal standard for verifiable credentials enables seamless international mobility.
- **New Trust Frameworks:** Employers can make faster, more confident hiring decisions, reducing time-to-hire and recruitment costs.

Singapore's Smart Nation initiative and OpenCerts project (developed by GovTech) already provide a foundation for blockchain-based credential verification in the country.

#### 5.3.6 Benefits, Cost Analysis, and Key Challenges

**Benefits:**
- Elimination of certificate fraud
- Instant credential verification (from days to seconds)
- Enhanced employer trust and graduate employability
- Reduced administrative costs for verification processing
- Alignment with Singapore's Smart Nation and OpenCerts initiatives

**Cost Estimate:**
